Typechecking in React Native is a process of verifying that the data and props (properties) passed between components are of the expected data 
types. This practice is essential for improving the reliability and maintainability of your React Native applications, as it helps catch 
type-related errors and provides better tooling and documentation

Using type checking in React Native helps prevent runtime errors, enhances code readability, and provides better documentation for the
components you create. Whether you choose PropTypes or TypeScript depends on your personal preference and the needs of your project.
