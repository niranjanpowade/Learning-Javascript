Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.
class - Fruit
object - Apple,Banana,Mango

When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and methods from the class.

What is this?
This is basically a reference to the object that is executing this peace of code.

Q-4 pillars of object oriented programming?
    encapsulation 
    polymorphism 
    abstraction

In OOPS we combine group of related variables and functions in a unit. We called that unit an object
Where variables are properties and functions are methods
Example - Car is an object with properties such as model and color where as methods such as start(),Move() and stop()
